I GUESS HE
DIDN'T KNOW THAT TI
ALMOST DIED WHEN MY
JACKPOT BRACELET
WENT NUTS. HE DIDN’T KNOW

THAT VENOM SAVED ME,

EVEN THOUGH VENOM

WAS DYING TOO.

THAT WE
NEED TO STAY
BONDED NOW OR WE
BOTH DIE--THE ODD HE PROBABLY
COUPLE WITH THOUGHT WE
EXTRA GOO. CHOSE THIS.

MY WACKY
ROOMMATE
SAYS IT WAS

WEIRD.

YEAH.
THAT'S...THAT IS
DISAPPOINTING.
FROM HIM.

I HOPE SO. THAT GUY'S
BEEN MY HERO SINCE HIGH
SCHOOL--HE MADE ME TAKE
A LOOK AT MYSELF,
YOU KNOW?

BUT...MAN.
THAT IS NOT

HOW YOU TREAT
A FRIEND...

I THOUGHT YOU
AND SPIDEY WERE
FRIENDS, BUT EVEN
IF YOU WERE TOTAL

STRANGERS... I I DON’T
MEAN, GEEZ. KNOW. IT WAS

WEIRD. I PROBABLY
CAUGHT HIM ON
JUST...A REALLY

BAD D,

FLASH?
WHAT

WOULD
YOU SAY WE
ARE?
