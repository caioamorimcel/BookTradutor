MONTHS AGO.

OUR LIVES ARE WOVEN THROUGH WITH POWERFUL BUT FRAGILE THREADS.

HUMAN CONNECTIONS.

CALLING THEM A ‘WEB’ IS TOO ON THE NOSE, EVEN FOR ME...

...BUT I BELIEVE THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS FORM THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE.

AND I LET MINE SNAP.

IT WASN'T TOTALLY MY FAULT.

BUT MAYBE IT WAS. I DON’T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE.

TRUTH IS, THE WHY DOESN'T ALN MATTER...
