PETER!
THIS PLACE
IS A WONDER!
My CELL IS
HUGE!

I HOPE
I HAVE SOME
TERRIBLE PARASITE
AND MUST ENDURE
THEIR HOSPITALITY

AND “I-SCREAM”
FOR MONTHS!

oy nd

TRY NOT TO
DESTROY THE
BAXTER BUILDING
BEFORE YOU GET

THE ALL CLEAR.
OKAY?

MISS YOU.
GOOD LUCK

RECONSTRUCTING

THE TATTERS OF
aoe ew YOUR LIFE--!

MORE DAYS,

GLITCH. THEN

WE'LL FIGURE
OUT NEXT

WEEKS OF LETTERS
FROM MAY, HUNDREDS
OF VOICEMAILS FROM
EVERYONE I KNOW.

PEOPLE JOKE
ABOUT HAVING TO
“CATCH UP ON LIFE,”
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

RIGHT NOW.
FOCUSED.
