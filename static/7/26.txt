YOU KEEP TRYING
TO FIGHT THIS, EDDIE,
TRYING TO CHANGE
THE REALITY.

TRYING TO
CONTROL US.

YOU CAN'T, AND
THE SOONER YOU
REALIZE THAT, THE
BASIER THIS WILL
ALL BECOME.

NO. VENOM
(SN'T THE ANSWER
TO YOUR PROBLEMS...
BECAUSE THERE
(S NO PROBLEM.

KILLING KILLERS
|S A GOOD WAY TO
LIVE. KEEPS US BOTH

HEALTHY AND STRONG.

POWERFUL.

LISTEN. YOU'RE
EXHAUSTED. YOUR
REFUSAL TO DO
WHAT YOUR BODY
NEEDS ISN'T DOING
YOU ANY FAVORS, AND
I KNOW THAT TIME
WITH DYLAN WAS
STRESSFUL.

GET SOME

REST. (T'LL ALL
BE CLEARER IN
THE MORNING.

FINE. JUST...
YEAH. JUST LET
ME BE, CARNAGE.
I NEED TO
SLEEP.

SHUT UP,
CARNAGE.

I KNOW
YOU LIKE THE WAY
WE FEEL WHEN WE
KILL. I CAN FEEL
IT TOO.

OF COURSE,
EDDIE. WHATEVER
YOU SAY.
