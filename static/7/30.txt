IS HE SPIDER, OR IS
HE SYMBIOTE...OR
IS HE NEITHER?

It’s a battle with the past this
month as lots of things come back
to haunt our Hulks! In INFERNAL
HULK #4, Hulk takes it a little

Hulkscape!

Meanwhile, in PLANET SHE-
HULK #4 out in space, his cousin
She-Hulk is throwing down with
her ex(?)-boyfriend Jack of Hearts!
They used to be so happy!

What could suck more than that,
you ask? How about fighting a
LITERAL BLACK HOLE? Which

z i hat Hulk is doing in HULK:
